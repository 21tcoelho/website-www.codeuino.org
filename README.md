# CODEUINO  
Its been long that we have been spreading the word "Open Source" but now its time to put all sayings on action. I am Open Source Initiative member and would love to discuss this with you that we are building up an organisation named as "Codeuino" after interacting with lots of people around the globe. In this we are just focusing on building up a project named as Codeuino Social Platform which is similar to the Facebook. 

## Description 
As we know that there are lots of people who contribute to Open Source Software within Open Source Organisations. but while contributing many organisations lose there potential contributors because either the contributor finds difficulty in that or does not get an appropriate path .So for this we have thought of an idea like a badge which will appear on contributor's profile and when a contributor does not come in touch with any potential organisation to which he/she is contributing then that badge will get fades away or change then organisation can reach to them and ask them and help them . It would also reduce the burden on maintainers maintaining the various projects.
