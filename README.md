# FOSSWORLD

@Shrey Batra Well, its been long that we have been spreading the word "Open Source" but now its time to put are saying on Actions. I am open Source Initiative member and would love to discuss with this with you that we are building up an Organisation named as "FOSSWorld" after interacting with lots of people around this globe. In this we are just focusing on building up a project named as FOSSWorld Social Platform which is similar to the Facebook 

Description - as we know there a re loads of people who contribute to Open Source Software within Open Source Organisations. but while contributing many organisations lose there potential contributors because wither the contributor finds difficulty in that or does not get an appropriate path so for this we have thought of an idea like a badge which will appear on Contributor profile and when a contributor does not come in touch with any potential organisation to which he/she is contributing then that badge will get fades away or change then organisation can reach to them and ask them and help them . It would also reduce the burden on maintainers maintaining the various projects.
